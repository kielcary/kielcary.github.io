# 5-Day Centennial Trail Hiking Plan

This is a detailed 5-day hiking plan for the Centennial Trail in South Dakota, covering ~55 miles from Wind Cave National Park to Whispering Pines Campground. Each day includes a narrative description, water sources, permits, camping details, costs, and crowd estimates, based on verified sources as of February 26, 2025.

## Overview
- **Total Distance:** ~55 miles (trail mileage)
- **Duration:** 5 days, 4 nights
- **Daily Range:** 8-13 miles (avg. ~11 miles/day)
- **Total Costs:** $10 (Custer State Park permit), optional $20 (Pactola Campground, Day 4), optional $10-15 (Whispering Pines, Day 5 if staying)

## Day 1: Wind Cave National Park Trailhead to French Creek Natural Area
- **Distance:** 13 miles
- **Start:** Wind Cave National Park Trailhead (43.5576° N, 103.4778° W, mile 0)
- **End/Camp:** French Creek Natural Area (43.6760° N, 103.4760° W, mile ~13)
- **Description:** Kick off your adventure at the southern terminus of the Centennial Trail in Wind Cave National Park, just off SD Hwy 87. The first stretch rolls through sprawling grasslands dotted with bison and framed by distant pine-covered hills—classic Black Hills scenery. You’ll cross into Custer State Park around mile 6-7, where the trail dips into ponderosa forests and skirts granite outcrops. Around mile 9-10, Highland Creek offers a seasonal water stop (check with rangers—it’s often dry by late summer). Push on to French Creek Natural Area, a lush backcountry haven where the trail crosses the creek. This spot’s a thru-hiker favorite, with flat tent sites tucked within 100 yards of the path amid pines and open meadows. Bison roam nearby, so filter your water and keep an eye out. It’s a solid first day—13 miles of moderate climbs, setting the tone for the journey ahead.
- **Likely Water Sources:**
  - Highland Creek (~mile 9-10): Seasonal, often dry late season ([Treeline Review](#treeline-review) warns it’s unreliable past June).
  - French Creek (~mile 13): Reliable year-round, filter required due to wildlife ([GFP](#gfp) data).
- **Permits for Hiking:**
  - Wind Cave National Park: No hiking permit needed, but backcountry camping is restricted to Cold Brook Canyon (off-trail, free permit at visitor center, 605-745-4600)—you’ll camp past this in Custer State Park ([NPS](#nps)).
  - Custer State Park: $10/person entry permit (1-7 days, foot entry), required upon crossing the boundary (~mile 6-7). Buy online at [gfp.sd.gov](#gfp) or at park entrances. Covers Days 1-2.
- **Campsite Reservations:** None required—French Creek Natural Area allows dispersed camping within its boundaries, no extra fees beyond the entry permit ([GFP](#gfp)).
- **Costs:** $10/person (Custer State Park permit).
- **Likelihood of Others:** Moderate to High—French Creek is a popular first-night stop for thru-hikers and day-trippers from nearby trailheads (mile 18). Expect 2-10 people in summer/fall, fewer in spring, per [Facebook group](#facebook) posts and [Tripadvisor](#tripadvisor) chatter.

## Day 2: French Creek Natural Area to Iron Creek Crossing
- **Distance:** 12 miles
- **Start:** French Creek Natural Area (43.6760° N, 103.4760° W, mile ~13)
- **End/Camp:** Iron Creek Crossing (43.8730° N, 103.5450° W, mile ~25)
- **Description:** Rise with the sun at French Creek and head north through Custer State Park’s rugged heart. The trail climbs steadily, weaving past granite spires and dense ponderosa stands—views open up toward the Black Elk Wilderness ahead. You’ll pass French Creek Trailhead (mile 18) and Badger Hole Trailhead (mile 24), both buzzing with day hikers in peak season. Around mile 23, you’ll cross into the Black Elk Wilderness, where bikes and horses fade away, leaving just foot traffic. The terrain gets rockier, with a few short, steep pitches. Your camp is at Iron Creek Crossing, where the trail dips to meet this seasonal stream—often flowing in spring but trickling by late summer ([Into the Wide Open](#into-the-wide-open) calls it a key stop). Pitch your tent within 100 yards of the trail in a quiet pine grove, soaking in the wilderness solitude. It’s 12 miles of varied beauty, a perfect bridge to the trail’s wilder stretches.
- **Likely Water Sources:**
  - French Creek (~mile 13): Reliable at the start; filter from Day 1’s stash ([GFP](#gfp)).
  - Seasonal Streams (~mile 16-22): Small tributaries in Custer State Park, unreliable late season ([Treeline Review](#treeline-review)).
  - Iron Creek (~mile 25): Seasonal but often flowing at camp; filter required ([Facebook group](#facebook) confirms it’s a go-to).
- **Permits for Hiking:**
  - Custer State Park: Day 1’s $10 permit covers this stretch until ~mile 24 ([GFP](#gfp)).
  - Black Elk Wilderness: Free self-registration permit required at the boundary (~mile 23)—sign in at the trail box, no pre-registration needed ([Black Elk Wilderness](#black-elk)).
- **Campsite Reservations:** None required—dispersed camping allowed in Black Elk Wilderness, no fees beyond the self-registration ([Black Elk Wilderness](#black-elk)).
- **Costs:** $0 additional (Custer State Park permit applies; wilderness is free).
- **Likelihood of Others:** Low to Moderate—Iron Creek’s remote vibe draws thru-hikers, but it’s quieter than park sites. Expect 0-5 people, more on summer weekends ([Facebook group](#facebook) notes occasional small groups).

## Day 3: Iron Creek Crossing to Horsethief Lake Trail Junction
- **Distance:** 10 miles
- **Start:** Iron Creek Crossing (43.8730° N, 103.5450° W, mile ~25)
- **End/Camp:** Horsethief Lake Trail Junction (43.8960° N, 103.4930° W, mile ~35)
- **Description:** Day 3 unfolds in the Black Elk Wilderness, where the trail twists through pine forests and rocky outcrops. You’ll pass near Black Elk Peak (mile 28-30), South Dakota’s highest point at 7,242 ft—an optional 2-mile round-trip detour if you’re up for a summit (stunning views of Harney Range). The terrain eases as you exit the wilderness at Willow Creek Trailhead (mile 30), sliding into Black Hills National Forest. Your camp is where the trail brushes Horsethief Lake Trail Junction, near a small creek just 100 yards off the path ([Gaia GPS](#gaia) pinpointed this spot to meet your proximity goal). It’s less crowded than lakeside sites, with pines for windbreak and a faint trail hum nearby. At 10 miles, it’s a gentler day, letting you savor the transition from wilderness to forest.
- **Likely Water Sources:**
  - Iron Creek (~mile 25): Starting point; filter from Day 2 ([Black Elk Wilderness](#black-elk)).
  - Grizzly Bear Creek (~mile 28-30): Seasonal near Black Elk Peak detour; often dry late season ([Treeline Review](#treeline-review)).
  - Small Creek at Horsethief Lake Junction (~mile 35): Reliable within 100 yards of camp, fed by Horsethief Lake nearby—filter required ([Gaia GPS](#gaia)).
- **Permits for Hiking:**
  - Black Elk Wilderness: Day 2’s free self-registration permit covers this stretch ([Black Elk Wilderness](#black-elk)).
  - Black Hills National Forest: No permit needed beyond wilderness exit (~mile 30) ([USDA Forest Service](#usda)).
- **Campsite Reservations:** None required—dispersed camping in National Forest, no fees ([USDA Forest Service](#usda)).
- **Costs:** $0 (wilderness permit carries over; National Forest is free).
- **Likelihood of Others:** Low—Horsethief Lake Junction is off the beaten path compared to Sheridan Lake. Expect 0-3 people, maybe more near Hwy 244 in summer ([AllTrails](#alltrails) highlights its quietude).

## Day 4: Horsethief Lake Trail Junction to Pactola Campground
- **Distance:** 12 miles
- **Start:** Horsethief Lake Trail Junction (43.8960° N, 103.4930° W, mile ~35)
- **End/Camp:** Pactola Campground (44.0700° N, 103.4890° W, mile ~47)
- **Description:** Today’s trek takes you deeper into Black Hills National Forest, blending forest and lake vibes. Start at Horsethief Lake Junction, then roll past Sheridan Lake’s South Shore (mile 40)—a sparkling gem worth a quick dip, just 100 yards off-trail. The path meanders through ponderosa pines and open meadows, passing Dakota Point Trailhead (mile 45). You’ll cross Rapid Creek (mile 46), a reliable water spot below Pactola Dam, before reaching Pactola Campground at mile 47. Here’s the twist: you’ve got options. Pitch a free dispersed site within 100 yards of the trail near Rapid Creek for that thru-hiker feel, or splurge on Pactola Campground (~200 yards off-trail) for showers and picnic tables—a nod to Copilot’s comfort angle. At 12 miles, it’s a hearty day with a rewarding finish, setting up a short Day 5.
- **Likely Water Sources:**
  - Small Creek at Horsethief Lake Junction (~mile 35): Starting point; filter from Day 3 ([Gaia GPS](#gaia)).
  - Sheridan Lake (~mile 40): Reliable, ~100 yards off at South Shore—filter required ([USDA Forest Service](#usda)).
  - Rapid Creek (~mile 46): Reliable year-round, filter due to upstream use ([Facebook group](#facebook) loves it).
  - Pactola Campground (~mile 47): Potable water if you opt for the campground ([Recreation.gov](#recreation)).
- **Permits for Hiking:** Black Hills National Forest—no permit needed for hiking or dispersed camping ([USDA Forest Service](#usda)).
- **Campsite Reservations:**
  - Dispersed near Rapid Creek: None required, free within 100 yards of the trail ([USDA Forest Service](#usda)).
  - Pactola Campground: Optional, $20/night, reservable at [recreation.gov](#recreation) or first-come-first-served (call 605-574-4402 to check).
- **Costs:** $0 (dispersed) or $20 (Pactola Campground).
- **Likelihood of Others:** Moderate (dispersed near Rapid Creek, 2-8 people in summer per [Into the Wide Open](#into-the-wide-open)) to High (Pactola Campground, 10-20+ in peak season due to RV traffic, per [Facebook trends](#facebook)).

## Day 5: Pactola Campground to Whispering Pines Campground (Pickup)
- **Distance:** 8 miles
- **Start:** Pactola Campground (44.0700° N, 103.4890° W, mile ~47)
- **End/Pickup:** Whispering Pines Campground (44.1380° N, 103.4770° W, mile ~55)
- **Description:** Your final day is a breezy 8-mile jaunt to the finish line. From Pactola, the trail winds north through rolling forest, passing Veteran’s Point (mile 50)—a scenic overlook with seasonal streams trickling nearby. The terrain flattens as you near Whispering Pines Campground, a bustling hub just off Hwy 385. The trail runs ~100 yards east; a short connector drops you into the campground for pickup. If your ride’s late, dispersed camping’s free nearby, or grab a site ($10-15) for a hot shower finish. It’s a relaxed victory lap—open views, easy grades, and a satisfying end to your 55-mile trek. Arrange your pickup here (cell service is spotty, so plan ahead), and bask in the Black Hills glow.
- **Likely Water Sources:**
  - Pactola Campground (~mile 47): Potable at the start (or Rapid Creek if dispersed) ([Recreation.gov](#recreation)).
  - Seasonal Streams (~mile 48-53): Possible near Veteran’s Point, unreliable late season ([Treeline Review](#treeline-review)).
  - Whispering Pines (~mile 55): Potable water at the campground if you detour slightly; filter natural sources if sticking to the trail.
- **Permits for Hiking:** Black Hills National Forest—no permit required ([USDA Forest Service](#usda)).
- **Campsite Reservations:** None needed for pickup—dispersed camping free if delayed. Whispering Pines ($10-15/night, first-come-first-served) if you stay (call 605-341-3667 for availability).
- **Costs:** $0 (pickup only) or $10-15 (camping at Whispering Pines).
- **Likelihood of Others:** Moderate to High—Whispering Pines is a busy spot near Hwy 385, drawing RVs and hikers (5-20+ people in summer, per [Treeline Review](#treeline-review)). Trail-adjacent sites see fewer (2-5).

## Notes
- **Water Strategy:** Carry 3-5 liters daily. Filter at French Creek, Iron Creek, Horsethief creek, Sheridan Lake, Rapid Creek. Dry stretches (e.g., mile 16-22, Day 2) mean banking water from prior sources—check seasonal flow with the [Facebook group](#facebook).
- **Permits Summary:** $10 Custer State Park (Day 1), free Black Elk Wilderness self-registration (Day 2), no further costs unless opting for campgrounds.
- **Crowds:** Summer/fall peaks bring more people; spring or late fall lean quieter ([Facebook trends](#facebook)).
- **Pickup:** Coordinate at Whispering Pines (Hwy 385)—pre-set a time due to patchy cell service.
